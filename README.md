# python-basic
A collection of simple python programs made by me.

They are based on basic python concepts, viz. objects & classes, polymorphism, inheritance, etc.

Feel free to refer to them for a deeper understanding on a few python concepts. A bit of online research might be needed for a beginner to understand them completely.

Feel free to reach out to me at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyanshul/) for any queries.

Happy Learning :)
