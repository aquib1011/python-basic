#Complex Number
A python program to implement a class for complex numbers, and perform basic operations.

The code contains a hard coding of the class so that concepts become clear, although complex numbers can easily be implemented in python with built-in functions.

*complexNubmer_OUTPUT.txt* contains a sample console input/output to demonstrate the working of the program.
